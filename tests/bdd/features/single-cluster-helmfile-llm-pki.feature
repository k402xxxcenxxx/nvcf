Feature: Install a local single-cluster NVCF stack with PKI-secured LLM transport
  As a self-managed NVCF operator,
  I want the Helmfile workflow with the LLM PKI addon enabled,
  so that an LLM function answers invocations over a QUIC tunnel whose
  trust chain is issued by the stack's own PKI.

  # Owns its own Helmfile environment (local-bdd-pki) for install-time PKI
  # values. The exported profile carries the OpenBao root CA and fingerprint
  # into registration values. The shared compute fixture uses secure QUIC so
  # the registered bundle trust remains active.

  Rule: Helmfile installs the control plane with the LLM PKI addon

    Background:
      Given these environment variables are set:
        | name            |
        | NGC_API_KEY     |
        | NVCF_CLI        |
        | REPO_ROOT       |
        | SAMPLE_NGC_ORG  |
        | SAMPLE_NGC_TEAM |
      And I copy the file "tests/bdd/fixtures/self-managed-local-bdd.yaml" to "deploy/stacks/self-managed/environments/local-bdd-pki.yaml"
      # PKI render requirements: dnsNames must cover the router's
      # advertised hostname (a single replica advertises its plain
      # service DNS name), allowedDomains constrains the OpenBao
      # signing role, and the provisioning hook needs the
      # nvcf-openbao-migrations tag (no default propagates from env).
      And I update yaml file "deploy/stacks/self-managed/environments/local-bdd-pki.yaml" with keys:
        | global.imagePullSecrets[0].name | nvcr-pull-secret                          |
        | global.helm.sources.repository  | ${SAMPLE_NGC_ORG}/${SAMPLE_NGC_TEAM}      |

      And I copy the file "tests/bdd/fixtures/nvcf-compute-plane-local-bdd.yaml" to "deploy/stacks/nvcf-compute-plane/environments/local-bdd-pki.yaml"
      And I update yaml file "deploy/stacks/nvcf-compute-plane/environments/local-bdd-pki.yaml" with keys:

        | observability.profile           | disabled                             |
      And I prepare self-managed secrets file "deploy/stacks/self-managed/secrets/local-bdd-pki-secrets.yaml" from template "deploy/stacks/self-managed/secrets/secrets.yaml.template" using the current NGC registry credential
      # Conflict precheck: ncp-local-cp's k3d serverlb claims
      # 0.0.0.0:8080/8443/10081, NATS on 4222, and the worker
      # callback port 10086, overlapping host ports single-cluster
      # ncp-local needs. Fail loudly so the operator runs
      # `make -C tools/ncp-local-cluster destroy-multicluster`
      # before retrying. `k3d cluster get` exits 1 when absent (k3d v5).
      When I run command "k3d cluster get ncp-local-cp"
      And the command exit code should be 1
      And a single-cluster ncp-local cluster is running
      And the "nvcr-pull-secret" image pull secret exists in namespaces:
