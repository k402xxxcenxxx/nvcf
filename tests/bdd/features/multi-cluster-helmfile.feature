Feature: Install a local multi-cluster NVCF stack with Helmfile
  As a self-managed NVCF operator,
  I want to use the documented Helmfile workflow across a local multi-cluster
  ncp-local topology,
  so that I can install the control plane on one cluster and register and
  install the NVCA operator on a separately registered compute cluster.

  # Helmfile installs the control plane from the operator-authored
  # environment. Registration then exports that installed environment as a
  # control-plane profile and passes it to the compute-plane Make target.
  # The feature runs `nvcf-cli init` explicitly before registration.
  # See tests/bdd/AGENTS.md "CLI vs Helmfile install paths".

  Rule: Helmfile installs the control plane on the control-plane cluster

    Background:
      Given these environment variables are set:
        | name            |
        | NGC_API_KEY     |
        | SAMPLE_NGC_ORG  |
        | SAMPLE_NGC_TEAM |
      # The multi-cluster fixture starts from local service-DNS
      # endpoint values, then the Background overlays
      # operator-specific registry values before the first Helmfile
      # install. Later scenarios reuse that install instead of
      # reinstalling with different secrets or URLs.
      And I prepare Helmfile environment "local-bdd" for stack "self-managed" from fixture "tests/bdd/fixtures/self-managed-local-bdd-multi.yaml" with values:
        | global.imagePullSecrets[0].name               | nvcr-pull-secret                                                    |
        | global.helm.sources.repository                | ${SAMPLE_NGC_ORG}/${SAMPLE_NGC_TEAM}                                |
        | global.image.repository                       | ${SAMPLE_NGC_ORG}/${SAMPLE_NGC_TEAM}                                |

      And I prepare Helmfile environment "local-bdd" for stack "nvcf-compute-plane" from fixture "tests/bdd/fixtures/nvcf-compute-plane-local-bdd-multi.yaml" with values:
        | global.imagePullSecrets[0].name | nvcr-pull-secret                     |
        | global.helm.sources.repository  | ${SAMPLE_NGC_ORG}/${SAMPLE_NGC_TEAM} |
        | global.image.repository         | ${SAMPLE_NGC_ORG}/${SAMPLE_NGC_TEAM} |
        | observability.profile           | disabled                             |
      And I prepare self-managed secrets file "deploy/stacks/self-managed/secrets/local-bdd-secrets.yaml" from template "deploy/stacks/self-managed/secrets/secrets.yaml.template" using the current NGC registry credential
      # Conflict precheck: single-cluster ncp-local's k3d serverlb
      # claims 0.0.0.0:8080/8443/10081, and ncp-local-cp also
      # needs NATS on 4222 plus the worker callback port 10086.
      # Fail loudly so the operator runs
      # `make -C tools/ncp-local-cluster destroy CLUSTER_NAME=ncp-local`
      # before retrying. `k3d cluster get` exits 1 when absent (k3d v5).
      And I run command "k3d cluster get ncp-local"
      And the command exit code should be 1
      And multi-cluster ncp-local compute clusters are running:
        | ncp-local-compute-1 |
      # The Helmfile install runs against whatever ambient kubectl
      # context is set. Switch to the control-plane cluster so the
      # subsequent pull-secret applies and the install target both
      # land on k3d-ncp-local-cp.
      And command has succeeded:
        """
        kubectl config use-context k3d-ncp-local-cp
        """
      And the "nvcr-pull-secret" image pull secret exists in namespaces:

        | nats-system      |
